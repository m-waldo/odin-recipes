    <h3>For The Sauce</h3>

        <li>1 small onion, minced</li>
        <li>1 large garlic clove, minced</li>
        <li>1 can of crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tsp of oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp of paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For putting it all together</h3>

        <li>1-2 small tomatoes, sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>Roasted red pepper (optional)</li>

        <li>Green olives (optional)</li>
        <li>Oregano (to top)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to prepare it</h2>
    <h3>The steak</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the pounded steak into a large baking dish. 
        Season the steak with salt and pepper and cover it with milk. (Add a little extra milk if the steak is not completely covered.)</li>
        <li>Cover the dish and refrigerate for 8-12 hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>The sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the minced onion and garlic, and saute until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the tomatoes, oregano, paprika, chile flakes, and salt. 
        Bring the sauce to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened, 10-12 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Putting It All Together</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the marinating meat from the refrigerator 1 hour before you want to grill it, to let it come to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Preheat grill to a medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Drain the milk from the steak, discarding the milk. Pat the steak dry.</li>
        <li>Place the steak on your preheated grill and grill the first side for 5-7 minutes, uncovered.</li>
        <li>Flip the flank steak.</li>
        <li>Spread the cooked side with your prepared pizza sauce. 
        Spread the mozzarella cheese over the sauce, and top with the tomatoes (and other toppings if desired).</li>
        <li>Cover the grill and cook for an additional 3-5 minutes, until the steak is done and the cheese has melted.</li>
        <li>Remove the steak from the grill and let it stand for 5 minutes before slicing, to let the juices settle.</li>
        <li>Garnish the matambre a la pizza with oregano to serve (if desired). Serve with roasted (or grilled) potatoes and grilled bread.</li>
    </ol>
