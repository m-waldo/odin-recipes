    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>Milanesa de carne is a very traditional dish in Argentina.
         It's coincidentally very similar to the german 'Schnitzel', but it's covered with bread crumbs instead of flour.</p>
    <p>This is a very simple dish, but also very popular in several south-american countries.
         It can be found in any 'rotiser√≠a' in Argentina, and you can eat it on a plate or as a sandwich!</p>
    <p>Although it has different variations in its meat (the 2nd most popular being chicken), 
        we'll be making it with veal, which is the most popular one.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 veal fillets (1cm width)</li>
        <li>1 bag of bread crumbs</li>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch of pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch of oregano</li>
        <li>A little bit of frying oil (just enough to cover the pan)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to make a good Milanesa:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The first thing to do is to season the meat with salt, pepper and oregano. Then, spread it on top of the bread crumbs until the meat is fully covered (on both sides).</li>
        <li>In a bowl, beat the eggs and dip the meat in the container in order to batter it. Then, bread the meat again to keep the preparation sticked to it.</li>
        <li>Now is the time to start heating up the oil inside the pan. Remember you just need to "paint" the surface with it. Wait until the oil reaches a temperature hot enough, and fry the milanesas on both sides until reaching a nice toasty color.</li>
        <li>Remove the excess oil from the milanesas by putting them on top of some kitchen paper towels. Your milanesas are ready to eat! Make sure to try them with some lime sprayed on top. You can serve them with some french fries, mashed potatoes or even a nice green salad.</li>
    </ol>
