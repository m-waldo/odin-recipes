# odin-recipes
This is my first project, the goal is to create a basic recipes webpage.
The objective of this project is to integrate all the different concepts that i've been learning about HTML.
Once the project is finished, it's gonna display an understanding on basic HTML concepts such as tags, elements and attributes.
